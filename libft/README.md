## Description
Libft is a library that contains a collection of custom C functions developed as part of the 42 curriculum. These functions are designed to replicate and extend the functionality of existing standard C library functions, as well as provide additional utility functions that can be used in various C projects.

## Features
- Replication of standard C library functions, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and more.
- Additional utility functions for manipulating strings, characters, memory, and linked lists.
- Modular and well-documented code for easy integration and understanding.
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and correctness of the functions.
- Compatible with multiple platforms, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MirkokriM/libft.git`
2. Change into the libft directory: `cd libft`
3. Compile the library: `make`
4. Link the library to your project:
   - Add the following flag to your compiler command: `-L/path/to/libft -lft`
   - Include the header file in your source code: `#include "libft.h"`
5. Start using the functions from the library in your project.
